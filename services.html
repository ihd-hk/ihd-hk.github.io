<h2>Acoustic</h2>

We also carry out site-surveys and provide an emergency studies-service for the problematical already-built facilities, recommending buildable recovery strategies.</p>

<p>We steer projects from planning through design, construction, testing, and commissioning with better solutions. We help clients achieve their beautiful acoustical ambiances that are both pleasant and productive from everyday situations to performance environments.</p>

<h4>Specialties of services:</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Architectural acoustics</li>
  <li>Environmental noise control</li>
  <li>Forensic acoustics</li>
  <li>Mechanical noise and vibration control</li>
  <li>Noise mitigation</li>
  <li>Noise surveys</li>
  <li>Sound system design</li>
</ul>

<p>We add value to our service by working through our Client’s stated needs, and as well as realising these, also pro-actively raising and discussing additional improvements that may not have been covered. Almost uniquely in our market, our acoustics and AV teams will consult one another to optimise our design in consideration of our respective disciplines, even if not contracted to handle both.</p>

<p>We are able to optimise and also scientifically predict the outcome of our design, using various simulation and modelling software applications, making our solutions as safe as possible, depending finally on the contractors build-quality.</p>

<h2>Audio-Visual & multimedia</h2>
<p>Audio-Visual consultancy has been at the core of our services since our inception in 2003. With more than 150 years of combined experience, our audio-visual consultants are attentive-to-detail, being meticulous yet thoughtful in their design. We guide contractors throughout the process to deliver the optimal audio-visual results for our clients. We also undertake audio-visual audits to validate the quality assurance for clients.</p>

<p>We work across the full audio-visual portfolios from spatial, technical to operational audio-visual design. By collaborating closely with acoustics and lighting designers, our experts help clients integrate technology into multiple challenging environments. Our experienced consultants save clients CAPEX expenditure and maximising subsequent ROI through better, more flexible and effective design solutions. Through better customer or guest experience, smoother visits or use of facilities, successful presentations etc, the customers or guests are more likely to return.</p>

<h4>Specialties of services:</h4>
<ul>
 <li>Architectural and Area Lighting Control</li>
 <li>Audio Systems from live-performance, theatre, and auditorium, to mass distributed background music systems</li>
 <li>Audio-modelling and simulation</li>
 <li>Audio, Video, and Control Distribution</li>
 <li>Display Systems for large-format LED and projection-mapping</li>
 <li>Leisure and Entertainment Sound, Image and Lighting</li>
 <li>IPTV, Interactive Video, Holographic Display Systems</li>
 <li>Networked AV and Communications</li>
</ul>

<p>Through incorporation of USB-extension to meeting and conference room user’s devices, as well as effortless wireless connectivity of the same, we are able to bring about simple, dependable, and better conferencing in all kinds of spaces. BGM Background music systems may appear simple, but we are able to enhance their performance in an unusual way by specially processing the sound in noisy areas so that the normally-unheard low-volume components become audible, making for BETTER sound and a BETTER future for the guests.</p>

<p>For museum and experience centres, we add in an often-forgotten human sense – smell; by using special devices to release professional aromas such as coffee, swamp, spice market etc, we bring increased realism and better experience to the visitors. Use of projection-mapping to create large areas of video, enables transformation of building exteriors, but also of small objects, in fascinating ways, again making for better guest and visitor experience. Attention also to everyday needs, such as our universal need to charge our phones, means that we recommend and add in intelligent POU (power-over-USB) wired- and wireless charging- in all kinds of innovative ways in meeting room, health club, guestroom, and other environments; these devices tend to be more and more IoT-based, being networked and monitored for useful statistics, making for better life for the users, and better data for the hosts. We are working with a manufacturer too, on voice-control using on-premise voice server, to prevent the users voice ever entering the internet, affording better security and privacy.</p>
